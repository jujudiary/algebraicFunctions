# algebraicFunctions
I am starting this project to present a method for computing and web-based displaying of algebraic functions using a combination of Mathematica, WebGL and Javascript. 
A description of the work I am doing can be found at my blog:  jujusdiaries.com where I have an embedded real-time 3D viewer of the function described in Section 1.
