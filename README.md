# algebraicFunctions
This project is a respository of Mathematica, HTML, WebGL, and Javascript code regarding algebraic functions, w(z), of the form:
f(z,w)=a_0(z)+a_1(z)w+a_2(z)w^2+...+a_n(z)w^n=0  where z and w are complex numbers and a_i(z) is a polynomial function of z.
A description of the functions can be found at jujusdiaries.com which includes an inbeded version of index.html in Section 1 of that blog.
The Mathematica file algebraicFunction.nb is not yet in a version ready for public use as it is not adequately formatted and commented although Mathematica users would certainly be capable of following it.  Newer versions will be forthcoming.
Note the Mathematica stylesheet ILEStylesheet.nb, while not necessary, does format algebraicFunctions.nb in a more pleasant format.
